# Health Indices Calculator tool

-   Calculates the health indices from the relative abundance of gut microbiome, such as HACK_top_17_score, Shannon, Simpson, GMHI, GMHI_HACK_Top_17, Jaccard, Kendall uniqueness, and Dysbiosis score.

-   This can help to infer the distinction between control and diseased sample groups.

-   For visualization, a boxplot is also created, and the Wilcoxon test is implemented to test the significance between groups.
